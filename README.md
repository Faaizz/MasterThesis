## Master Thesis - Alberto Franco

My name is Alberto Franco and I'm going to take my Master's degree in Automation Engineering at the Università degli Studi di Padova. I’m beginning my Master Thesis in the Laboratório de Automação e Robótica (LAR) at the Mechanical Department of the Universidade de Aveiro. My supervisor is Professor Vitor Santos.

The purpose of this blog is to, not only, document the progress of my master thesis, but also help me organize my work and my tasks for this project.

### Week 0 - (2nd October 2018 / 8th October 2018)
This week marks the beginning of my master thesis.

I started with the installation of the ROS environment (ROS Kinetic Kame) in my personal computer and I did all of the beginner and intermediate ROS tutorials at <http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials> and C++/OpenCV tutorials.

I thought about the thesis proposals and I started to do research about it.

### Weeks 1&2 - (9th October 2018 / 22nd October 2018)
During these weeks I continued to practice with ROS and C++ doing simple exercises. Moreover these weeks were also dedicated to do some initial research and to write the preliminary report. This was important for me, not only, to introduce myself to the process of autonomous navigation and the projects that have already been developed in this field, but also, to organize my thoughts in tasks to come in this project.
