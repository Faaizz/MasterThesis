    abstract = { In this paper we present queueing-theoretical methods for the modeling, analysis, and control of autonomous mobility-on-demand (MOD) systems wherein robotic, self-driving vehicles transport customers within an urban environment and rebalance themselves to ensure acceptable quality of service throughout the network. We first cast an autonomous MOD system within a closed Jackson network model with passenger loss. It is shown that an optimal rebalancing algorithm minimizing the number of (autonomously) rebalancing vehicles while keeping vehicle availabilities balanced throughout the network can be found by solving a linear program. The theoretical insights are used to design a robust, real-time rebalancing algorithm, which is applied to a case study of New York City and implemented on an eight-vehicle mobile robot testbed. The case study of New York shows that the current taxi demand in Manhattan can be met with about 8,000 robotic vehicles (roughly 70\% of the size of the current taxi fleet operating in Manhattan). Finally, we extend our queueing-theoretical setup to include congestion effects, and study the impact of autonomously rebalancing vehicles on overall congestion. Using a simple heuristic algorithm, we show that additional congestion due to autonomous rebalancing can be effectively avoided on a road network. Collectively, this paper provides a rigorous approach to the problem of system-wide coordination of autonomously driving vehicles, and provides one of the first characterizations of the sustainability benefits of robotic transportation networks. }

Sufficient conditions for recursive feasibility and asymptotic convergence of the given scheme are presented. Furthermore, a method of choosing a suitable terminal penalty and the corresponding terminal constraint is proposed. To illustrate the implementation of the NMPC scheme, the path following problem of a car-like mobile robot is discussed and the control performance is confirmed by simulation results."}

Six different types of biodiesels derived from soybean oil, waste cooking oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil, palm oil and jatropha oil were blended with different volume ratios (B5 (5 vol. {\%} biodiesel — 95 vol. {\%} diesel), B10 and B20). The cold filter plugging point (CFPP) and the cloud point had an effect on the startability and driveability of both the passenger car and the light duty truck. The startability and driveability of the passenger car with all biodiesel blends (B5) were generally good at −20 °C. In the light duty truck, biodiesel blends (B10 and B20) of soybean, waste cooking, rapeseed and jatropha tended to be good at −20 °C in the startability and driveability tests than the biodiesel blends (B10 and B20) of cottonseed and palm. In particular, the palm biodiesel blend (B10) failed at −20 °C, and the palm biodiesel blend (B20) also failed at −16 °C in the startability test. The cold flow properties of biodiesel dictate that the length of the hydrocarbon chains and the presence of unsaturated structures significantly affect the low temperature properties of biodiesel.},

This investigation presents a path-planning algorithm for autonomous vehicle (AV) that uses infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and behaviour based hybrid controllers for circumventing moving obstacles. The I2V communication provides the measurements required for estimating the current vehicle position. Vehicle mounted sensors are used to ascertain the current obstacle position and the dynamical equations are used to predict the future obstacle position. The EKF then estimates the future position of the vehicle relative to the obstacles and uses a hybrid controller that switches among the possible control actions. Our results show that the EKF based path-planning algorithm is able to circumvent moving obstacles even with non-linear dynamics.},

@article{Li2016,
abstract = {This paper focuses on the real-time trajectory planning problem for autonomous vehicles driving in realistic urban environments. To solve the complex navigation problem, we adopt a hierarchical motion planning framework. First, a rough reference path is extracted from the digital map using commands from the high-level behavioral planner. The conjugate gradient nonlinear optimization algorithm and the cubic B-spline curve are employed to smoothen and interpolate the reference path sequentially. To follow the refined reference path as well as handle both static and moving objects, the trajectory planning task is decoupled into lateral and longitudinal planning problems within the curvilinear coordinate framework. A rich set of kinematically feasible path candidates are generated to deal with the dynamic traffic both deliberatively and reactively. In the meanwhile, the velocity profile generation is performed to improve driving safety and comfort. After that, the generated trajectories are carefully evaluated by an objective function, which combines behavioral decisions by reasoning about the traffic situations. The optimal collision-free, smooth, and dynamically feasible trajectory is selected and transformed into commands executed by the low-level lateral and longitudinal controllers. Field experiments have been carried out with our test autonomous vehicle on the realistic inner-city roads. The experimental results demonstrated capabilities and effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning framework and algorithms to safely handle a variety of typical driving scenarios, such as static and moving objects avoidance, lane keeping, and vehicle following, while respecting the traffic rules.},

Although path planning has been extensively investigated since the beginning of robotics, there is no agreement on how to measure the performance of a motion algorithm. This paper presents a new approach to perform robot trajectories comparison that could be applied to any kind of trajectories and in both simulated and real environments. Given an initial set of features, it automatically selects the most significant ones and performs a statistical comparison using them. Additionally, a graphical data visualization named polygraph which helps to better understand the obtained results is provided. The proposed method has been applied, as an example, to compare two different motion planners, FM2 and WaveFront, using different environments, robots, and local planners.},

@article{Bimbraw2015,
abstract = {The field of autonomous automation is of interest to researchers, and much has been accomplished in this area, of which this paper presents a detailed chronology. This paper can help one understand the trends in autonomous vehicle technology for the past, present, and future. We see a drastic change in autonomous vehicle technology since 1920s, when the first radio controlled vehicles were designed. In the subsequent decades, we see fairly autonomous electric cars powered by embedded circuits in the roads. By 1960s, autonomous cars having similar electronic guide systems came into picture. 1980s saw vision guided autonomous vehicles, which was a major milestone in technology and till date we use similar or modified forms of vision and radio guided technologies. Various semi-autonomous features introduced in modern cars such as lane keeping, automatic braking and adaptive cruise control are based on such systems. Extensive network guided systems in conjunction with vision guided features is the future of autonomous vehicles. It is predicted that most companies will launch fully autonomous vehicles by the advent of next decade. The future of autonomous vehicles is an ambitious era of safe and comfortable transportation.},

@article{Broggi2013,
abstract = {This paper presents the vision of the Artificial Vision and Intelligent Systems Laboratory (VisLab) on future automated vehicles, ranging from sensor selection up to their extensive testing. VisLab's design choices are explained using the BRAiVE autonomous vehicle prototype as an example. BRAiVE, which is specifically designed to develop, test, and demonstrate advanced safety applications with different automation levels, features a high integration level and a low-cost sensor suite, which are mainly based on vision, as opposed to many other autonomous vehicle implementations based on expensive and invasive sensors. The importance of performing extensive tests to validate the design choices is considered to be a hard requirement, and different tests have been organized, including an intercontinental trip from Italy to China. This paper also presents the test, the main challenges, and the vehicles that have been specifically developed for this test, which was performed by four autonomous vehicles based on BRAiVE's architecture. This paper also includes final remarks on VisLab's perspective on future vehicles' sensor suite.},
